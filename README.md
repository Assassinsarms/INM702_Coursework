Task 1: Pathfinding Game, Task 2: Classification of MNIST, Task 3: Comparison with PyTorch

File name: T1Aaron_Mir_INM702_Task_1

This project contains a pathfinding game which uses an Agent in a Maze to find the shortest path from the top-left cell to the bottom right-cell of a 2D array where each element in this array represents the time an agent spends in the cell. Algorithms implemented include a Naive approach based on recursion, ant-colony optimisation and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path. In the zip file, there are .png files demonstrating examples of paths found by the agent.

To run this task, just run the Agent class cell, the IntMaze class cell and then depending on what algorithm you would like to test, you choose from the next 3 cells. You can modify the height and width of the maze, the name of the Agent and which algorithm you wish to run. For ant-colony optimisation, the input parameters of the start_game method correspond to the number of iterations, number of ants, alpha, beta and rho respectively. I have put default values in there.

At the output, the shortest path is shown on a graph of nodes which contain vectors showing the direction of the path. Note: Maze size should be NxN in order for the graph to show up properly.
